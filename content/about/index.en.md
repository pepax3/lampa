# About Me

Hello, and welcome to my cybersecurity world! 👋

I'm Pepa, a passionate cybersecurity enthusiast hailing from the beautiful country of Serbia, Europe 🇷🇸. My journey in the digital realm is fueled by an unquenchable curiosity about the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity.

## My Cybersecurity Journey

**HackTheBox Aficionado:** I have a deep love for challenges, and you'll often find me immersed in the virtual playground of HackTheBox 🎮. It's not just a hobby; it's a way of life. Solving intricate CTFs and hacking my way through diverse environments is what keeps me engaged and constantly learning.

**Road to OSCP:** Currently, I'm on an exciting journey towards achieving the coveted OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional) certification. My progress and insights are documented in detail on my [Medium blog](https://medium.com/@pepax3), where I share write-ups, tutorials, and valuable information about my experiences, challenges, and victories.

## My Blog and Writeups

I firmly believe that knowledge is most valuable when shared. That's why I maintain this website as a platform to showcase my cybersecurity insights and writeups. Here, you'll find a collection of my blog posts, detailed walkthroughs of my HackTheBox adventures, and much more.
